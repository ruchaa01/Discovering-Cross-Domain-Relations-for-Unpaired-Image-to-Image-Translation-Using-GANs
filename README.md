# Discovering-Cross-Domain-Relations-for-Unpaired-Image-to-Image-Translation-Using-Generative-Adversar
-Using the Disco GAN network, obtained qualitative results on an application to swap the gender from male to female and vice-versa by successfully transferring style, pattern from one domain to another, and preserving key attributes such as face identity, hair color, and orientation. -Tuning hyperparameters of batch-size and slicing training data improved the computational time that was required to obtain translated images. -By considering feature mapping loss between the two domains, evaluated the domain translation accuracy. -Built an Image Generator on the trained network for real-time face-swapping. The Image Generator successfully showed style transfer in the form of hair color, facial attributes, expressions, and orientation.
